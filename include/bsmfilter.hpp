 * @section JPO-CVDP
 * 
 * The United States Department of Transportation Joint Program Office (JPO)
 * Connected Vehicle Data Privacy (CVDP) Project is developing a variety of methods
 * to enhance the privacy of individuals who generated connected vehicle data.
 * 
 * Connected vehicle technology uses in-vehicle wireless transceivers to broadcast
 * and receive basic safety messages (BSMs) that include accurate spatiotemporal
 * information to enhance transportation safety. Integrated Global Positioning
 * System (GPS) measurements are included in BSMs.  Databases, some publicly
 * available, of BSM sequences, called trajectories, are being used to develop
 * safety and traffic management applications. BSMs do not contain explicit
 * identifiers that link trajectories to individuals; however, the locations they
 * expose may be sensitive and associated with a very small subset of the
 * population; protecting these locations from unwanted disclosure is extremely
 * important. Developing procedures that minimize the risk of associating
 * trajectories with individuals is the objective of this project.
 * 
 * @section The Operational Data Environment (ODE) Privacy Protection Module (PPM)
 * 
 * The PPM operates on streams of raw BSMs generated by the ODE. It determines
 * whether individual BSMs should be retained or suppressed (deleted) based on the
 * information in that BSM and auxiliary map information used to define a geofence.
 * BSM geoposition (latitude and longitude) and speed are used to determine the
 * disposition of each BSM processed. The PPM also redacts other BSM fields.
